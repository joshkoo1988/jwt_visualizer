# AI JWT Visualizer & Security Explainer

A sleek, single-page React + TypeScript app that decodes JWT tokens and uses OpenAI to explain their contents and flag potential security risks. Built with Tailwind CSS and deployed serverlessly via GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **JWT Decoder** – Instantly decodes the header and payload of any JWT
- **AI Explainer** – Uses OpenAI (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5) to:
  - Explain each JWT claim in plain English
  - Detect common security risks (e.g., `none` algorithm, no expiration)
- **Error Handling** – Gracefully handles malformed or incomplete JWTs
- **Fully Responsive UI** – Built with Tailwind CSS for modern UX
- **Deployed via GitHub Pages** – No backend required
